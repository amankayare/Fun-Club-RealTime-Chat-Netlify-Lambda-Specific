## How it work's

This project is a real time chat application thru which muliple users can communicate 
over different channels known as rooms, no need to login with your credentials instead 
you can search and choose your character from the right panel of the welcome page.

Simply copy the name of your character and paste it into the given input field,then
you could select your room from the given choices.

You can also put your name in the character name field but in this case profile pic
would be the default one and you are not anonymous anymore.

In same way other users can join you in the same room and you guys can have fun with
your anonymous identity. 

Note : Across the rooms communication is not possible unless you join the same room.
